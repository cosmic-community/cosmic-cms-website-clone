🥉 **GPT 5.2** - Best Flexibility
Tied winner for creative writing with Claude. Offers solid performance across diverse content types with strong stylistic flexibility. Competitive pricing at $1.75/$14 per million tokens makes it attractive for high-volume operations.

**Our Recommendation:**

For most content teams, Claude Opus 4.5 is the strongest all-around choice. The combination of output quality, token efficiency, and sustained reasoning capabilities makes it worth the premium pricing, especially at scale.
